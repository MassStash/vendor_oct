Team-OctOs established 2013 - Octo-Kat
A team that truly believes in open source, freedom, and community... A rarity these days.

These are the vendor files used specifically for our builds.  Feel free to have a look around.  Maybe have a spot of tea.  Or drink a redbull or five.  Maybe even slap yo momma.  Freedom is magical.  Just like unicorns with rainbow farts.  Or big purple friendly guys that go by the name Grommish who are so huggable and cuddly that you could never, not even once, resist.
